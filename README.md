# Medical-Data-Program
Given a set of text documents with clinical trial data, with a number of drug  &amp; dose information on each trial patient, my C program was able to compute and predict drug absorption,  Elimination, and concentration at time t for a particular drug on a particular patient with a given drug ID and patient ID.

The Matlab File is used to display the absorption/concentration rate of the patient files over time
